    title: 'Taxation of Crypto in the United States',
    description: "Cryptocurrency is viewed as property and is taxed in the US as either Capital Gains Tax - when you sell, swap, spend, or gift crypto - or as Income Tax – when you get paid in crypto, by mining crypto, receiving crypto from airdrops/ hard forks, staking rewards, or by referral bonuses-. You won't pay tax when you buy crypto, hold crypto, or move your crypto between wallets. Gifting crypto is tax-free, provided that your crypto gift does not exceed $15,000 in value. For gifts over this threshold, donors may have to file a Gift Tax Return Form 709. Similarly, donations are not subject to Capital Gains Tax, provided the donation is made to a qualified charitable organization. With the dawn of DeFi, there are many more ways to earn crypto: Earning interest through yield farming on lending protocols/ Earning new liquidity pool tokens, governance or reward tokens/ Lending your crypto to platforms to earn interest/ or by earning crypto dividends. For many of these transactions – particularly newer DeFi protocols – there is not yet any clear IRS guidance on how these would be subject to tax. Were you looking for a crypto tax professional?

    title: 'Can the IRS track Cryptocurrencies?',
    description:"Yes - the IRS can track crypto! So if you're asking yourself can the IRS really know about my crypto investments? Stop right there. The IRS have confirmed they're working with crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance US and Kraken to share customer information to ensure crypto investors are reporting their crypto gains and income accurately. Also, the America COMPETES Act 2022 was filed in Congress on the 25th of January 2022 and could give the US Treasury extensive powers over the crypto industry. In few words, it gives the US Treasury the power to block any crypto transaction without any formal process. The reality is that any crypto exchanges that uses Know Your Customer (KYC) identification may be asked to share this information with the tax authority. The IRS is using this information to send out letters to remind investors to report their crypto transactions and pay their crypto taxes, as well as to conduct audits and seize assets from those avoiding taxes. The best way to stay tax compliant is to report your crypto taxes accurately to the IRS. Do you need help? I’d be more than willing to assist. Schedule a free call using the button below.",

    title: 'Do you pay tax when you buy crypto in the US?',
    description: "Buying crypto with any fiat currency like USD, CAD or GBP is tax free – but it’s really important you keep records of your crypto transactions – this is so you can keep a detailed account of your cost base, so you can later calculate your crypto capital gains and losses accurately when you later dispose of crypto assets. However, if you’re buying your crypto with another cryptocurrency, for example ETH with BTC – this is a taxable event in the US. The IRS view this as two separate transactions, first you sell crypto for a fictional amount of dollars, and you are then buying crypto with these fictional dollars. Even though you never received any fiat currency, you still need to pay tax on the sale of the BTC. In other words, buying, swapping, or trading crypto with crypto is taxable in the US. Feel free to schedule a call to discuss your crypto tax situation.",

    title: 'Do you pay income tax when transferring Crypto?',
    description: "When you move Crypto around between your own wallets is a tax-free event – this isn’t seen as a disposal, and you don’t need to report it or pay Capital Gain Tax. However, it’s important to keep track of these transactions because if you’re paying a transfer fee in crypto – better known as “gas” fees – this is subject to Capital Gain Tax. So, while transfers are tax free, gas fees are not if you paid the fee in cryptocurrency. You’ll need to calculate your cost basis and capital gain or loss. The IRS has not yet issued clear guidance on whether transfer fees could be added to your cost base of an asset. Of course, doing this for each transaction can be time consuming and a Crypto Tax Accountant might be the right option for you. Do you need help? Let’s have a quick call to discuss your crypto-tax situation. I’m looking forward to speaking with you. ",
